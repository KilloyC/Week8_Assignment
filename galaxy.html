        <div>THE BIG BANG<br><br>
            The belief among many scientists, astronomers and cosmologists is the Universe as we know it was created in a massive explosion that not only created the majority of matter, but the physical laws that govern our ever-expanding cosmos. This is known as The Big Bang Theory. For almost a century, the term has been bandied about by scholars and non-scholars alike. 
            This should come as no surprise, seeing as how it is the most accepted theory of our origins.<br><br>The basics of the theory are fairly simple. In short, the Big Bang hypothesis states that all of the current and past matter in the Universe came into existence at the same time, roughly 13.8 billion years ago. At this time, all matter was compacted into a very small ball with infinite density and intense heat called a Singularity. 
            Suddenly, the Singularity began expanding, and the universe as we know it began.<br><br>While this is not the only modern theory of how the Universe came into being for example, there is the Steady State Theory or the Oscillating Universe Theory it is the most widely accepted and popular. Not only does the model explain the origin of all known matter, the laws of physics, and the large scale structure of the Universe, 
            it also accounts for the expansion of the Universe and a broad range of other phenomena.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2015-12-big-theory.html">link to cited source</a></div> <!--adds a link to the cited sources below the text.-->
        <div>THE MILKY WAY<br><br>
            Is a huge collection of stars, dust and gas. It's called a spiral galaxy because if you could view it from the top or bottom, it would look like a spinning pinwheel. The Sun is located on one of the spiral arms, about 25,000 light-years away from the center of the galaxy. Even if you could travel at the speed of light (300,000 kilometers, or 186,000 miles, per second), it would take you about 25,000 years to reach the middle of the Milky Way.<br><br>
            The Milky Way gets its name from a Greek myth about the goddess Hera who sprayed milk across the sky. In other parts of the world, our galaxy goes by other names. In China it's called the “Silver River,” and in the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa, it's called the “Backbone of Night.”<br><br>
            We can see about 6,000 stars from Earth. That may seem like a lot of stars, but it's actually only a small part of the whole. If you think of the entire galaxy as a giant pizza, all the stars you can see from Earth fall within about one pepperoni on that pizza. In fact, for every star you can see, there are more than 20 million you cannot see. Most of the stars are too faint, too far away or blocked by clouds of cosmic dust.<br><br>
            If you could see our galaxy from the side, it would look like a huge, thin disk with a slight bump in the center. This flat shape is caused by the galaxy spinning around. Everything in our spinning galaxy would fly off into space if it weren't for the force of gravity.<br><br>

        <div>THE FUTURE<br><br>
            Someday our little corner of the universe will have a ringside seat for one of the biggest events in the cosmos. Two billion years from now, the Milky Way and Andromeda, our closest neighboring galaxy, will begin to fuse into one giant football-shaped galaxy. The gigantic merger will relocate our solar system and thereby change forever the appearance of the constellations, although it's unlikely that any Earthly life will be greatly disturbed.<br><br>
            Astronomers have known about the prospective merger for decades, as the two galaxies--currently separated by about 2.5 million light years--inexorably churn toward each other.<br><br>
